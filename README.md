Fine-Tuning BERT for Text Classification: A Comprehensive Notebook

This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook for fine-tuning BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) on a text classification task. BERT is a powerful transformer-based language model pre-trained on a massive amount of text data, and fine-tuning it can lead to excellent performance on various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Notebook Overview

This notebook guides you through the process of fine-tuning a BERT model for text classification using the Hugging Face Transformers library and PyTorch. It covers the following key steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data for fine-tuning.
Tokenization: Using the BERT tokenizer to tokenize and encode the text data.
Model Definition: Loading a pre-trained BERT model and customizing it for the classification task.
Training Loop: Implementing the training loop with custom data loaders and optimizing the model.
Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance on a validation dataset and reporting metrics.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Exploring techniques for hyperparameter tuning with advanced approaches.
Additional Analysis: Conducting further analysis such as sentiment analysis, word frequency analysis, and more.
